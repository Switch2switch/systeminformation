# systeminformation
A 3DS homebrew application to show system information

<h2>THIS CODE IS SLOPPY AND BUGGY</h2>
It's not suggested to modify the software it could make the program unstable (trust me)
The software is 100% save just don't screw anything up.

<h2>How to install</h2>
Download the .3dsx file
Drag it to the 3ds folder on the root of your sd card
Launch the application in homebrew.
